## IconStepper

A simple to use icon stepper widget, wherein, each icon defines a step. Hence,
total number of icons define total number of steps. Primarily designed to show
steps as icons.

### IconStepper - Usage Note

* __Important:__ IconStepper `direction` argument controls whether the stepper is displayed
horizontally or vertically. A horizontal IconStepper can be wrapped within a Column
with no issues, however, if wrapped within a row it _must also be_ wrapped within
the built-in _Expanded_ widget. Same applies for the vertical IconStepper.

* IconStepper fires the `onStepReached(int index)` callback, which provides
the index of the Step that is reached. This callback can be used to control the
widget that appears when a certain step is reached.

* To customize the color, border, etc. of an IconStepper, simply wrap it inside
a Container and specify the `decoration` argument.

* To enable validation before the next step is reached, set the `steppingEnabled`
property to an appropriate value in a `StatefulWidget`.

## ImageStepper

A simple to use image stepper widget, wherein, each image defines a step. Hence,
total number of images define total number of steps. Primarily designed to show
steps as images.

### DotStepper - Usage Note

* __Important:__ It is important that a call to `goNext` and `goPrevious` is
controlled by two variables in a `StatefulWidget` with a call to `setState` in
order for the DotStepper to work. __Please look at the Example.__

## NumberStepper

A simple to use number stepper widget, wherein, each number defines a step. Hence,
total count of numbers define total number of steps. Primarily designed to show
steps as numbers.
